============
Prerequisit:
============

You will need to install libSerial.  Download the source tarball:

    wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/libserial/files/libserial/0.6.0rc1/libserial-0.6.0rc1.tar.gz

Untar with the below command:

    tar zxvf libserial-0.6.0rc1.tar.gz

this will extract the files in local directory.  Now we will need to modify the
code to fix a known bug (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25230535/libserial-error-cannot-set-baud-rate-as-115200):

    cd src
    gedit SerialStreamBuf.h

Change the line from:

    #ifdef __linux__
                BAUD_460800 = SerialPort::BAUD_460800,
    #endif
                BAUD_DEFAULT = SerialPort::BAUD_DEFAULT,
                BAUD_INVALID

to 

    #ifdef __linux__
                BAUD_460800 = SerialPort::BAUD_460800,
    #endif
                BAUD_DEFAULT = SerialPort::BAUD_DEFAULT,
                BAUD_INVALID = 0x9999

Next add the line below to SerialPort.h 

    #include <unistd.h>


Before we can build libserial, we need to first install 'sip', a prerequsite of libserial:

    sudo apt-get install python-sip-dev


Also, if you have any previously install libserial, you will need to purge it by:

    sudo apt-get purge libserial-dev


Now save the file and build at the project root:

    cd ..
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install


Check to make sure the new libraries are created in /usr/local/lib.  Also make sure there
is lingering libserial.so.x in /usr/lib directory. 


Now, we need to make sure the dynamic linker knows where the new libserial libraries are:

    cat /etc/libc.conf

to make sure /usr/local/lib is in it.  Finally, add the following lines to the .bashrc 
file at the home directory:

    cd . 
    sudo gedit .bashrc


and add the following line at the end of the file:


    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib 
 

=================================
Building the Example Serial Code
=================================

Now untar the rp2w_serial.tar.gz in another directory.  Build the code using the following
command:

    g++ -I. testapp.cpp rp2w_serial.cpp -o testapp -L/usr/local/lib -lserial

Now run the output executable, with USB serial plugged into Serial Port 1 on the Arduino:

    sudo ./testapp

The leading 'sudo' is important.  You should get something like this repeating:

    [ 83  49 127 127 129 248 127 127 126  69 118   9   7   0  69  79  70 ]
    robot.update success
    0x7F7F81F8
    0x7F7F7E45
    0x76
    0x09
    0x07
    0x00


The testapp assume the USB serial appears at /dev/ttyUSB0.  If it is at a different place,
change the code (see testapp.cpp).
